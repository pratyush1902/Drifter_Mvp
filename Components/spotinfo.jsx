    <p class="text-[#0e151b] text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
      Kyoto, once the capital of Japan, is a city on the island of Honshu. It's famous for its numerous classical Buddhist temples, as well as gardens, imperial palaces,
      Shinto shrines, and traditional wooden houses. It's also known for formal traditions such as kaiseki dining and geisha entertaining. The Japanese are known for their
      politeness, and Kyoto is no exception. Bowing is a common way to greet people. It's important to take off your shoes before entering a home or temple. When you are
      eating, it's polite to say 'itadakimasu' before you start and 'gochisosama deshita' after you finish. Tipping is not expected in Japan. When visiting a temple or
      shrine, it's important to be respectful. You should remove your hat and sunglasses, speak quietly, and turn off your cell phone. If you visit a shrine, you may see
      people washing their hands and mouth. This is a purification ritual called temizu. When you do this, it's important to remember that you should never drink the water.
